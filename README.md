# :dna: Genetic TSP :dna:

Demo of genetic algorithm solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

I always wanted to try this because I find genetic algorithms really mind blowing. Also,
this is probably going to be the code for a tech talk of mine on Elo7.

This is not meant to have great performance (neither in terms of speed or accuracy), it
is instead more focused in displaying the process visually and serve as an introduction
to the topic of genetic algorithms.

### Run it locally :microscope:
Right now this project is not hosted anywhere so if you'd like to test it, you can do so
by running `make run`. Once it builds the image and starts the server, you can access
it at `http://localhost:8501/`.
